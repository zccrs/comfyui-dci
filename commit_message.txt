fix: resolve node connectivity issues by unifying BINARY_DATA type

DCIPreviewNode and BinaryFileSaver could not connect to DCIFileNode output
due to data type mismatch. This change unifies all binary data handling
to use the BINARY_DATA type consistently across all nodes.

Changes:
- Change DCIFileNode output type from DCI_BINARY_DATA to BINARY_DATA
- Remove unused DCI_BINARY_DATA type from codebase and documentation
- Update all related documentation and test files
- Add connectivity tests to verify the fix
- Simplify data type system for better node compatibility

This ensures all DCI-related nodes can properly connect and work together
in ComfyUI workflows.
